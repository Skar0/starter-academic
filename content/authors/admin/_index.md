I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at the [University of Mons](https://web.umons.ac.be/en/) (UMONS) in Belgium. I am co-supervised by [Véronique Bruyère](http://informatique.umons.ac.be/staff/Bruyere.Veronique/) (UMONS) and [Jean-François Raskin](http://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/jfr/) ([Université libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/en/ulb-homepage)). My research interests regard solving parity and generalized parity games efficiently and notions of equilibria in non-zero-sum multiplayer games. I am also very interested in the field of machine learning.
