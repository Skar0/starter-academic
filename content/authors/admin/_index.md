I completed a PhD in the Computer Science department of the [University of 
Mons](https://web.umons.ac.be/en/) (UMONS) in Belgium. I was co-supervised 
by [Véronique 
Bruyère](http://informatique.umons.ac.be/staff/Bruyere.Veronique/) (UMONS) 
and [Jean-François Raskin](http://di.ulb.ac.be/verif/jfr/) ([Université 
libre de Bruxelles](https://www.ulb.be/en/ulb-homepage)). My research interests regarded solving parity and generalized parity games efficiently and notions of equilibria in non-zero-sum multiplayer games. I am also very interested in the field of machine learning.
