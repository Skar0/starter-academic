title: Forest fire detection using CNN
summary: This project is an attempt to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect the presence or the start of a forest fire in an image. The idea is that this model could be applied to detect a fire or a start of a fire from (aerial) surveillance footage of a forest. The model could be applied in real-time to low-framerate surveillance video (with fires not moving very fast, this assumption is somewhat sound) and give alert in case of fire.
