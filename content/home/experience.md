    description: I studied the possibility of using constraint programming (CP) in a radio configuration tool
    to improve its performance and capabilities. I participated in the daily Scrum stand-up
    meetings with the team and made a presentation of my work at the end of each sprint. I
    first learned the main concepts of CP and analyzed how the tool worked from design and
    test documentation. I then developed several working prototypes of increasing complexity
    along with detailed internal documentation (in English). The final prototype recreated the
    network generation part of the tool using CP. The implementation was done using Java 8
    and the Choco Solver CP library
