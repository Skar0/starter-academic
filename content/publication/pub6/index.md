abstract: We report on the last four editions of the reactive synthesis competition (SYNTCOMP 2018-2021). We briefly describe the evaluation scheme and the experimental setup of SYNTCOMP. Then, we introduce new benchmark classes that have been added to the SYNTCOMP library and give an overview of the participants of SYNTCOMP. Finally, we present and analyze the results of our experimental evaluations, including a ranking of tools with respect to quantity and quality of solutions.
