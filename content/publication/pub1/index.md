abstract:  Parity games have been broadly studied in recent years for their applications to controller synthesis and verification. In practice, partial solvers for parity games that execute in polynomial time, while incomplete, can solve most games in publicly available benchmark suites. In this paper, we combine those partial solvers with the classical recursive algorithm for parity games due to Zielonka. We also extend partial solvers to generalized parity games that are games with conjunction of parity objectives. We have implemented those algorithms and evaluated them on a large set of benchmarks proposed in the last LTL synthesis competition.
